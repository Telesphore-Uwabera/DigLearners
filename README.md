## Quick Start

### Prerequisites
- Node.js >= 16.0.0
- npm >= 8.0.0

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/diglearners/diglearners-platform.git
   cd diglearners-platform
   ```

2. **Install dependencies**
   ```bash
   npm run install:all
   ```

3. **Start development servers**
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

This will start:
- Backend API server on http://localhost:5000
- Frontend development server on http://localhost:3000

### Default Login Credentials

Admins log in via the Teacher login and use the Teacher dashboard.

| Role | Email | Password | Access Notes |
|------|-------|----------|--------------|
| **Teacher/Admin** | `pierre@diglearners.rw` | `teacher123` | Admins have elevated permissions within the teacher dashboard |
| **Teacher** | `marie@diglearners.rw` | `teacher123` | Class management, student oversight, lesson assignment |
| **Student** | Use registration code | N/A | Student login via name, grade, registration code |

**Note**: Demo credentials are for development/testing. Replace in production.

### Production Build

```bash
npm run build
npm start
```

## Database Schema

The platform implements the Entity-Relationship Diagram (ERD) with the following entities:

### Core Entities
- **User**: Users with roles (Admin, Teacher, Learner)
