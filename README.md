## Quick Start

### Prerequisites
- Node.js >= 16.0.0
- npm >= 8.0.0

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/vuwase/DigLearners.git
   cd DigLearners
   ```

2. **Install dependencies**
   ```bash
   npm run install:all
   ```

3. **Start development servers**
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

This will start:
- Backend API server on http://localhost:5000
- Frontend development server on http://localhost:3000

### Teacher Email Notifications

Teachers receive email alerts when students complete lessons or gamified activities. To enable this:

1. Create a `.env` file inside the `backend/` directory (if it doesn’t exist yet).
2. Provide Gmail app credentials (generate an App Password from the `uwasevaste@gmail.com` account):
   ```bash
   EMAIL_USER=uwasevaste@gmail.com
   EMAIL_PASSWORD=<gmail app password>
   EMAIL_FROM=uwasevaste@gmail.com
   EMAIL_HOST=smtp.gmail.com   # optional override
   EMAIL_PORT=465              # optional override
   ```
3. Restart the backend server (`npm run dev` inside `backend/`).

The notification emails are sent from `uwasevaste@gmail.com` using these settings.

### Test Login Credentials

- Teacher/Admin access (Teacher UI with admin features if role=admin):
  - Email: `testteacher@diglearners.com`
  - Password: `password123`

- Student access:
  - Obtain a registration code from a teacher via `Dashboard → Register Student`
  - Login at `/login?type=student` with: Full name, Grade, Registration Code

### Default Login Credentials

Admins log in via the Teacher login and use the Teacher dashboard.

| Role | Email | Password | Access Notes |
|------|-------|----------|--------------|
| **Teacher/Admin** | `testteacher@diglearners.com` | `password123` | Admins have elevated permissions within the teacher dashboard |
| **Teacher** | (create additional via admin tools) |  |  |
| **Student** | Use registration code | N/A | Student login via name, grade, registration code |

**Note**: Demo credentials are for development/testing. Replace in production.

### Production Build

```bash
npm run build
npm start
```
