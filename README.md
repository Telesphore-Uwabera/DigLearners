# DigLearners Platform

A comprehensive digital literacy platform designed specifically for Rwandan primary schools, implementing offline-first architecture with gamification and multilingual support.

## 🎯 Project Overview

DigLearners is a web-based platform that enhances foundational digital literacy in Rwandan primary schools through:

- **Offline-First Architecture**: Works seamlessly in low-bandwidth and rural areas
- **Gamification System**: Points, badges, levels, and leaderboards to motivate learning
- **Multilingual Support**: English and Kinyarwanda language options
- **Role-Based Access**: Separate interfaces for Learners, Teachers, Parents, and Administrators
- **Child-Friendly Design**: Large touch targets, high contrast, and accessibility features
- **Research Analytics**: Comprehensive data collection for educational research

## 🏗️ Architecture

The platform follows a three-tier architecture as defined in the UML diagrams:

### Backend (Node.js + Express + SQLite)
```

├── middleware/          # Authentication & authorization
├── services/           # Business logic
└── utils/             # Utility functions
```

### Frontend (React + PWA)
```

## 🚀 Quick Start

### Prerequisites
- Node.js >= 16.0.0
- npm >= 8.0.0

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/diglearners/diglearners-platform.git
   cd diglearners-platform
   ```

2. **Install dependencies**
   ```bash
   npm run install:all
   ```

3. **Start development servers**
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

This will start:
- Backend API server on http://localhost:3001
- Frontend development server on http://localhost:3000

### Default Login Credentials

The system comes with pre-configured test accounts:

| Role | Email | Password | Access Level |
|------|-------|----------|--------------|
| **Admin** | `admin@diglearners.rw` | `admin123` | Full platform access, user management, content creation |
| **Teacher** | `teacher@diglearners.rw` | `teacher123` | Class management, student oversight, lesson assignment |

**Note**: These are default credentials for development/testing. In production, these should be changed or removed.

### Production Build

```bash
npm run build
npm start
```

## 📊 Database Schema

The platform implements the Entity-Relationship Diagram (ERD) with the following entities:

### Core Entities
- **User**: Users with roles (Admin, Teacher, Learner, Parent)
- **LearningClass**: Classes managed by teachers
- **Lesson**: Educational content modules
- **Progress**: User progress tracking
- **Badge**: Gamification achievements
- **UserBadge**: User-badge relationships

### Relationships
- User ↔ LearningClass (Teacher-Class)
- User ↔ Progress (User-Progress)
- Lesson ↔ Progress (Lesson-Progress)
- User ↔ Badge (Many-to-Many via UserBadge)
- LearningClass ↔ Lesson (Many-to-Many via ClassLesson)

## 🎮 Gamification System
